# New File Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the new file upload flow as requested:

1. **User fills form + selects file**
2. **Frontend validates form input** (required fields, formats)
3. **Client sends form data WITH file to API route to validate + create DB record**
4. **Server validates, creates activity, uploads file, and attaches file URL**

## Implementation Details

### API Routes Created

#### 1. Create Activity API (`/app/api/activity/create/route.ts`)

- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Creates new activity with optional file upload in single request
- **Flow**:
  1. Validates user authentication
  2. Extracts and validates form data
  3. Creates activity record in database
  4. If file provided:
     - Validates file type and size
     - Uploads to Supabase Storage with name: `{activityId}.{extension}`
     - Updates activity record with file URL
  5. Returns success/error response with activity data

#### 2. Update Activity API (`/app/api/activity/[id]/update/route.ts`)

- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Updates existing activity with optional file replacement
- **Flow**: Similar to create but updates existing record

### Frontend Changes

#### Activity Form (`/components/activity/activity-form.tsx`)

- **Removed**: useActionState, server action dependencies
- **Added**: Custom handleSubmit function that calls API routes
- **Features**:
  - Client-side file validation
  - Progress indicators during upload
  - Proper error handling
  - Automatic file name generation (`recordId.extension`)

## File Upload Flow

### Create Activity:

```
1. User fills form + selects file
2. Form validates input client-side
3. FormData sent to /api/activity/create (includes file)
4. Server validates all data
5. Server creates activity record
6. Server uploads file to Supabase Storage: `{recordId}.{ext}`
7. Server updates activity with file URL
8. Returns complete activity data
```

### Update Activity:

```
1. User modifies form + optionally selects new file
2. Form validates input client-side
3. FormData sent to /api/activity/{id}/update (includes file if selected)
4. Server validates all data
5. Server updates activity record
6. If new file: Server uploads file (replaces existing)
7. Server updates activity with new file URL
8. Returns complete activity data
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Single Request**: Everything happens in one API call
2. **Atomic Operations**: Activity creation/update and file upload succeed/fail together
3. **Proper Cleanup**: If file upload fails, activity record is deleted
4. **File Naming**: Consistent naming pattern using record ID
5. **Validation**: Both client and server-side validation
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels

## File Storage

- **Bucket**: `activity-evidence`
- **Naming**: `{activityId}.{fileExtension}`
- **Allowed Types**: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX
- **Max Size**: 10MB
- **Replacement**: Files are replaced using `upsert: true`

## Status

✅ **Complete**: All functionality implemented and tested
✅ **Error Free**: No compilation or lint errors
✅ **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and server actions
✅ **Documentation**: Implementation documented

The new file upload flow is now fully implemented and ready for use!
